# rpicasso
## Picasso in Ruby

Had to prepare for a Ruby interview, so I did the CS challenge in Ruby to jog the memory.

Was a fun project, tried to keep things concise.

### Run the program:
```
ruby picasso.rb
```

### To run the demos at the command prompt:
```
O cs.pic
```

or

```
O author.pic
```

(that's O as in Open - it's case insensitive)

### To see the command history:
```
H
```
### For help enter:
```
?
```
### To quit:
```
Q
```
**Note: Creating a new canvas clears the command history.**
