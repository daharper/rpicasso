# rpicasso
Picasso in Ruby

Had to prepare for a Ruby interview, so I did the CS challenge in Ruby.

Was a fun project, tried to keep things concise.

There's two demo files in the demos folder.

1. Run the program:

ruby picasso.rb

2. Run a demo - at the command prompt enter:

o cs.pic

or

o author.pic

3. Type ? for help

Creating a new canvas clears the command history.
