# rpicasso
Picasso in Ruby

Had to prepare for a Ruby interview, so I did the CS challenge in Ruby.

Was a fun project, tried to keep things concise.

There's two example files in the demos folder.

1. Run the program:

ruby picasso.rb

2. To run a demo at the command prompt:

O cs.pic

or

O author.pic

(that's O as in Open - it's case insensitive)

3. Enter H for command history

4. Type ? for help

5. Q to quit

Creating a new canvas clears the command history.
